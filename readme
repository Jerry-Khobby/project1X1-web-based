This site is a simplified version of Wikipedia, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Pages

### Index Page

This is the homepage of the site. It provides a navigation system for the library of articles. The index page is a slider that appears from the right side of the navigation bar when the hamburger icon next to the "Explore" text is clicked. It includes options such as History, Earth and Environment, Literature and Arts, Medicine, People, Philosophy and Religion, Places and Animals, New Page, and Search. Clicking on any of these options will lead to various articles on the corresponding topics, except for New Page and Search.

### Entry Page

The entry page is the first page users see when opening the site. It contains the site's navigation bar with the group logo on the far left and a slider on the far right. The slider displays contents from the index page, providing navigation through the library. The main section of the entry page features a search button and input field for searching through items on the webpage. Additionally, it showcases headlines for trending educational topics. Clicking on any of these headlines will take you to a random page.

### Random Page

This page displays random articles about trending topics featured on the homepage (entry page) and the slider (index page). Clicking on the content in the slider will render random articles on this page.

### New Page

On the New Page, users can create new posts for the site. The page includes a form where new posts are created and displayed at the bottom before the footer on the same page.

### Edit Page

Clicking on any of the newly created posts from the New Page will redirect users to the Edit Page. Here, users can edit the content of their posts using a form. The updated content can then be re-posted. Data movement and interaction on this page were implemented using JavaScript.
